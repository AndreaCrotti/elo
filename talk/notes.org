* Who Am I

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Just to give a very brief introduction about myself, I work here at
Funding Circle, I have a moustache just because it's Movember and I've
been for most of my career a backend Developer.

Or well to be precise in a few jobs I was doing some frontend work as
well, but I would have never even considered doing Angular or Knockout
JS or CSS for fun!

In the last year instead I worked on 2 medium personal projects using
Clojure and Clojurescript and I actually really enjoy it.
Today I'm going to talk about one of the projects,

So today I'm going to talk about one of the projects I've been working
on, a platform to create leagues with your friends and keep track of
rankings.

#+END_NOTES

- senior software developer at Funding Circle
- API & backends for a long time
- saw the light with Clojure & Clojurescript

* Play

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Every respectable start-up out there has a few games, they are after
all a great way to bond and to take your mind off an annoying bug you
can't seem to solve.

However of course playing is even more fun if you make it competitive,
so we need a way to keep track of all the games and a way to rank the
players.

I've had internal leagues for table tennis and similar office sports
in various companies, where the tracking tool was sometimes just an
extremely complicated spreadsheet, and since there wasn't nothing here
at funding circle I just decided to build a new tool.

In this talk I will first talk about the algorithm used to rank
players and then introduce re-frame.

* Elo

#+BEGIN_NOTES
You might have heard of Elo in relation with Chess, where every
player, at least the good ones, have an elo score.  The name simply
comes from Elo Arpad, the creator of the algorithm, who actually
originally created this algorithm for chess players.

** Elo rating system

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Before we look at how Elo works in more detail, these are the main
features.  Elo is used to calculate theh *relative* skill level, so
your ranking will always depend on the other players in the same
league.

It can be used for any zero sum game, here we are only currently using
it for Fifa but table tennis pool or any other office sport would work
perfectly well.

Another point to keep in mind is that whenever you play a game the new
players rankings will only depend on the current rankings *and* the
result, nothing else. This is very important for scalability reasons
for example, you don't need to know anything about other games or the
whole history.

Two more thing are that the amount of points lost and won will depend
on the players ranking difference, so it's not a fixed amount like in
football for example, where if a team wins they get 3 points no matter
who they play against.

And lastly the average of the points is always the same.
#+END_NOTES

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- method for calculating the *relative* skill levels of players
- can be applied to *any* zero sum game (chess / tennis / table tennis...)
- new rankings *only* depends on current rankings and result
- points won or lost depend on the *ranking difference* between two players
- average of all the points is constant

** Demo time

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Let's see in practice how this works with a very simple demo.

#+END_NOTES

** Elo example

#+BEGIN_NOTES

You can compute the new rankings of two players with simply the current rankings and the result of the game.
Everyone starts from 1500, and overall that will always be the average of all the scores in the league.

#+END_NOTES

*A: 1500, B: 1500*

$E\_A =  \frac{1}{1 + 10 ^ \frac{RB - RA}{400}} = \frac{1}{1 + 10 ^ \frac{0}{400}}$
$E\_A = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$
$E\_B = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$

*A vs B (3-0):*

$R\_A = 1500 + (K * (1 - E\_A)) = 1500 + (32 * (1 - 0.5)) = 1516$
$R\_B = 1500 + (K * (1 - E\_B)) = 1500 + (32 * (0 - 0.5)) = 1484$

*A = 1516, B = 1484*

** Elo implementation (1)

$E\_A =  \frac{1}{1 + 10 ^ \frac{RB - RA}{400}}$

$R\_A = R\_A + (K * (1 - E\_A))$

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
(defn expected
  [diff]
  (/ 1.0 (inc (Math/pow 10 (/ diff 400)))))

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
(defn new-rating
  [old expected score]
  (+ old (* k (- score expected))))

#+END_SRC

** Elo implementation (2)

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes

(defn new-rankings
  [rankings [p1 p2 score]]

  (let [ra (get rankings p1)
        rb (get rankings p2)]

    (assoc rankings
           p1 (new-rating ra
                          (expected (- rb ra))
                          score)

           p2 (new-rating rb
                          (expected (- ra rb))
                          (invert-score score)))))

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  ;; P1 wins against same level opponent:
  (new-rankings {:p1 1500 :p2 1500} [:p1 :p2 0])
  ;; => {:p1 1484.0, :p2 1516.0}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  ;; P1 wins against much stronger opponent:
  (new-rankings {:p1 1300 :p2 1700} [:p1 :p2 1])
  ;; => {:p1 1329.090909090909, :p2 1670.909090909091}
#+END_SRC

* Re-frame

#+BEGIN_NOTES

Another very important piece of the puzzle is Re-Frame, which is a
great little framework to create SPAs doing Functional Reactive
Programming.

In this stack we have `React` at the bottom, which is the lower level
library. On top of that there is a Clojurescript wrapper called
`Reagent`, which hides all the javascript interop and give you a nice
Clojure interface to React.

#+END_NOTES

React → (Clojurescript) → Reagent → Re-Frame

** Reagent  Syntax

#+BEGIN_NOTES

I assume probably everyone knows about React, but it was quite a big
deal for the functional programming community, since it really works
extremely with functional languages.

The idea of the virtual dom allows you to focus just on pure functions
that simply render your content, knowing that your page will be
automatically updated whenever the data changes.

Reagent is just one of the bindings react in Clojurescript, and it
allows you to write 

#+END_NOTES

*JSX*

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript :tangle no
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}

#+END_SRC

*REAGENT*

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  (defn get-greeting
    [user]
    (if user
      [:h1 "Hello" [format-name user]]
      [:h1 "Hello, Stranger"]))

#+END_SRC

** Reagent rendering

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript :tangle no
  const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle yes
  (def element [:h1 "Hello, world"])

  (reagent/render-component element
                            (.-getElementbyid js/document "root"))

* Demo Time

#+BEGIN_NOTES

We are going to do a quick demo now, to show what it means to do full
stack development with Clojure and re-frame.  So we'll add a simple
new feature to our platform, simply showing some extra stats in the
player page.

To do this we'll need:

- one extra reagent component
- a re-frame subscription
- more business logic to compute the desired stats
- a bit of CSS to make it look pretty

#+END_NOTES

* Conclusions

#+BEGIN_NOTES

To conclude I just want to say that for me frontend development has
never been so fun.

So if you have any personal projects you'd like to try out
definitively give Re-frame a go, you won't regret it, careful you
might find it addictive though.

* Ideas for the demo
- change parameters of the Elo algorithm
- change slightly the Elo algorithm to take into consideration the goal difference
- add the rankings difference into the table of results
