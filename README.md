Compute the Elo ranking from Fifa games.

## Usage

### Local development

This project uses `figwheel-main` for all the reloading magic, so you
can just it locally with `lein build` or simply `jack-in` with `cider`
which should do the right thing out of the box (see [.dir-locals file](./.dir-locals.el)).

### Deployment

You can deploy this to Heroku directly or build an uberjar and deploy it on any other platform.

### Migrations

You can run database migrations with:

    lein migratus migrate
