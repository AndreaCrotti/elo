## Usage

### Local development

Get it running locally:

- run `lein dev` in one terminal (or `cider-in` with Cider)
- in another terminal run `lein garden auto` (this will compile
  automatically all the CSS)
- run `docker-compose up -d` to fire up your local db
- the first time run `./setup_db.sh`, this will migrate your local
  databases and seed them with randomly generated data

### CSS

CSS is written using `garden`

### Deployment

You can deploy this to Heroku directly or build an uberjar and deploy it on any other platform.

### Migrations

You can run database migrations with:

    lein migratus migrate
