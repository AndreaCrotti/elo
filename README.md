# elo

Compute the Elo ranking from Fifa games.

## Usage

### Local development

Run locally with `lein figwheel`

### Deployment

You can deploy this to Heroku directly or build an uberjar and deploy it on any other platform.

### Migrations

You can run database migrations with:

    lein migratus migrate

## Import data from a Google Spreadsheet

Download a csv and run:

    lein run -m elo.db sample.csv ids_mapping.edn

This will populate the local database with data from the CSV file, where the CSV contains data in this format:

    24/07/2018 10:00:15,Player1,Player2,3,1,reporter@email,Manchester United,Bayern Munich

And the `ids_mapping.edn` file contains mapping between player names and their UUID in the database, for example:

    {"Player1" "d27e2a00-3cf3-4cf2-a0ae-0166bf36b1cd"}
    
So all the players have to be created before.
